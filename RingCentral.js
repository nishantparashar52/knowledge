/* 
There is a project, which is a chat room with the possibility of video calls. The project is written in react, redux. Chat and video service uses a lot of common components, helpers, selectors and common redux store.

Team A is working on the chat room
Team B is working on the video calls

Suggest options and steps to improve the development processÂ 
*/

// Solution
/* 
Split the codebase into separate repositories for the chat room and video call features. This will allow each team to work on their feature independently, without conflicts.

Define clear APIs and interfaces for the communication between the chat room and video call features. This will ensure that the features can be integrated seamlessly when they are ready.

Extract the common components, helpers, selectors, and redux store into a shared library or module, using a framework or library that is suitable for the project, such as React, Angular, or Vue.

Create each Microfrontend as a separate project or module, using the same framework or library as the shared library.

Import the shared library or module into each Microfrontend and use the common logic and resources.

Use a communication protocol or mechanism to allow the Microfrontends to communicate with each other and share data as needed.

One way to enable communication between Microfrontends is by using module federation. Module federation is a feature of Webpack that allows separate Webpack builds to share modules at runtime. With module federation, each Microfrontend is built separately and deployed independently, but they can communicate with each other and share modules at runtime.

To use module federation, we can follow these steps:

Configure the Webpack module federation plugin in each Microfrontend project. The configuration should specify which modules can be shared and which modules can be consumed.

Deploy each Microfrontend separately, either on the same server or on different servers.

Use the Webpack module federation plugin to load shared modules from other Microfrontends as needed.

Implement a communication protocol or mechanism to allow the Microfrontends to communicate with each other and share data as needed.

Here is an example of how to use module federation in a Microfrontend architecture:

In the shared library or module, define a common component that can be shared between Microfrontends, such as a notification component:

*/
import React from 'react';

export const Notification = ({ message }) => {
  return (
    <div className="notification">
      {message}
    </div>
  );
};

// In each Microfrontend, import the shared module and use the Notification component:

import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Notification } from 'shared';

const handleSendMessage = (message) => {
  // Send message to chat room or video call
};

const handleReceiveMessage = (message) => {
  render(<Notification message={message} />, document.getElementById('notifications'));
};

// To use module federation, we need to configure the Webpack module federation plugin in each Microfrontend project. Here is an example of a Webpack configuration file that enables module federation:

const path = require('path');
const { ModuleFederationPlugin } = require('webpack').container;

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js',
  },
  plugins: [
    new ModuleFederationPlugin({
      name: 'chat',
      filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
      exposes: {
        './Notification': './src/Notification',
      },
      shared: ['react', 'react-dom', 'redux', 'react-redux'],
    }),
  ],
};
